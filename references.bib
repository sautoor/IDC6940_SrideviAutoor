	abstract = {We present an autoencoder that leverages learned representations to better measure similarities in data space. By combining a variational autoencoder with a generative adversarial network we can use learned feature representations in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction objective. Thereby, we replace element-wise errors with feature-wise errors to better capture the data distribution while offering invariance towards e.g. translation. We apply our method to images of faces and show that it outperforms VAEs with element-wise similarity measures in terms of visual fidelity. Moreover, we show that the method learns an embedding in which high-level abstract visual features (e.g. wearing glasses) can be modified using simple arithmetic.},

	title = {Variational autoencoders},
	abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a family of deep generative models with use cases that span many applications, from image processing to bioinformatics. There are two complimentary ways of viewing the VAE: as a probabilistic model that is fit using variational Bayesian inference, or as a type of autoencoding neural network. In this post, we present the mathematical theory behind VAEs, which is rooted in Bayesian inference, and how this theory leads to an emergent autoencoding algorithm. We also discuss the similarities and differences between VAEs and standard autoencoders. Lastly, we present an implementation of a VAE in PyTorch and apply it to the task of modeling the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits.},
